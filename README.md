# Make It There

If you can Make It There you can make it anywhere.

This is just a script to set up a basic (opinionated) Sinatra app. Just run: `make_it_there app_name`

This will:
- set up required files and directory structure (models, views)
- build a basic layout template
- create a config.ru file for using Rack up
- install gems (sinatra and shotgun)
